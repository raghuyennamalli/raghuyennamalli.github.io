Moreover, the content and gene expression of lipopeptide antibiotics was also lower than that in the BCF group. However, the pot experiments based on irrigation with appropriately diluted fermentation broth showed that the biocontrol effect of MCF on tomato Fusarium wilt was significantly higher than that of TCF (T. longibrachiatum culture fermentation) and BCF, and was approximately 15.79% higher than that of the BTF group which made by mixing equivalent amounts of BCF and TCF. In MCF broth, two microorganisms antagonized and coexisted, and the growth of T. longibrachiatum was inhibited. Using transcriptomic methods, we speculated that MCF can up-regulate the expression of genes related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism, oxidation\u2013reduction activity, sporulation, environmental information response and chemotaxis, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of B. amyloliquefaciens, which might enhance the nutrient substances metabolism and competitiveness, survival ability, colonisation, and adaptability to the environment to increase its biocontrol potential.", "keywords": "(\"Botrytis cinerea\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Botrytis cinerea\"[Organism] OR Botrytis cinerea[All Fields]) AND (\"carbon\"[MeSH Terms] OR carbon[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Botrytis cinerea", "source": "Botrytis cinerea", "title": "The transcription factor PDR-1 is a multi-functional regulator and key component of pectin deconstruction and catabolism in Neurospora crassa", "Accession": "GSE88985", "summary": "Background: Pectin is an abundant component in many fruit and vegetable wastes and could therefore be an excellent resource for biorefinery, but is currently underutilized. Fungal pectinases already play a crucial role for industrial purposes, such as for foodstuff processing. However, the regulation of pectinase gene expression is still poorly understood. For an optimal utilization of plant biomass for biorefinery and biofuel production, a detailed analysis of the underlying regulatory mechanisms is warranted. In this study, we applied the genetic resources of the filamentous ascomycete species Neurospora crassa to screen for transcription factors that play a major role in pectinase induction. Results: The pectin degradation regulator-1 (PDR-1) was identified through a transcription factor mutant screen in N. crassa. The \u0394pdr-1 mutant exhibited a severe growth defect on pectin and all tested pectin-related poly- and monosaccharides. Biochemical as well as transcriptional analyses of WT and the \u0394pdr-1 mutant revealed that while PDR-1-mediated gene induction was dependent on the presence of L-rhamnose, it also strongly affected the degradation of the homogalacturonan backbone. The expression of the endo-polygalacturonase gh28-1 was greatly reduced in the \u0394pdr-1 mutant, while the expression levels of all pectate lyase genes increased. Moreover, a pdr-1 overexpression strain displayed substantially increased pectinase production. Promoter analysis of the PDR-1 regulon allowed refinement of the putative PDR-1 DNA binding motif. Conclusions: PDR-1 is highly conserved in filamentous ascomycete fungi and is present in many pathogenic and industrially important fungi. Our data demonstrate that the function of PDR-1 in N. crassa combines features of two recently described transcription factors in Aspergillus niger (RhaR) and Botrytis cinerea (GaaR). The results presented in this study contribute to a broader understanding of how pectin degradation is orchestrated in filamentous fungi and how it could be manipulated for optimized pectinase production.
