[{"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "Differential gene expression analysis of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 strains in Aspergillus oryzae", "Accession": "GSE33542", "summary": "The potential for sexual reproduction in Aspergillus oryzae was assessed by investigating the presence and functionality of MAT genes. Previous genome studies had identified a MAT1-1 gene in the RIB40 reference strain. We now report the existence of a complimentary MAT1-2 gene and sequencing of an idiomorph region from A. oryzae strain AO6. This allowed the development of a PCR diagnostic assay, which detected isolates of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genotype among 180 strains assayed including industrial tane-koji isolates. Strains used for sake and miso production showed a near 1:1 ratio of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 mating-types, whereas strains used for soy sauce production showed a significant bias towards the MAT1-2 mating type. MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 isogenic strains were then created by genetic manipulation of the resident idiomorph, and comparisons were made of gene expression by DNA microarray and RT-PCR methodologies under conditions when MAT genes were expressed. 33 genes were found to be up-regulated greater than 10-fold in either the MAT1-1 host or MAT1-2 gene replacement strains relative to each other, showing that both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genes functionally regulate gene expression in A. oryzae in a mating-type dependent manner, the first such report from a supposedly asexual fungus. MAT1-1 expression specifically up-regulated an a-pheromone precursor gene, but most genes affected were of unknown function. Results are consistent with a heterothallic breeding system in A. oryzae, and prospects for the discovery of a sexual cycle are discussed.", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [22327593]}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "Transcriptome of Aspergillus oryzae following ER stress", "Accession": "GSE18851", "summary": "The Aspergillus oryzae, an important filamentous fungus used in food fermentation and enzyme industry, has been revealed to own prominent features in its genomic compositions by genome sequencing and various other tools. However, the functional complexity of the A. oryzae transcriptome has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we applied direct high-throughput paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to the transcriptome of A. oryzae under four different culture conditions and confirmed most of the annotated genes. Moreover, with high resolution and sensitivity afforded by RNA-Seq, we were able to identify a substantial number of novel transcripts, new exons, untranslated regions, alternative upstream initiation codons (uATGs) and upstream open reading frames (uORFs), which serves a remarkable insight into the A. oryzae transcriptome. We also were able to assess the alternative mRNA isoforms in A. oryzae and found a large number of genes undergoing alternative splicing. Many genes or pathways that might involve in higher levels of protein production in solid-state culture than in liquid culture were identified by comparing gene expression levels between different cultures. Our analysis indicated that the transcriptome of A. oryzae was much more complex than previously anticipated and the results might provide a blueprint for further study of A. oryzae transcriptome.", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [20392818]}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "MAT1-2 mating-type", "Accession": "GSM829553", "summary": "Aspergillus oryzae mycelium growth inducing mating-type gene", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "MAT1-1 mating-type", "Accession": "GSM829552", "summary": "Aspergillus oryzae mycelium growth inducing mating-type gene", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "Solid_culture_ER_stress_RNA-Seq rep 2", "Accession": "GSM521246", "summary": "cell under ER stress in solid culture", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "Solid_culture_control_RNA-Seq rep 2", "Accession": "GSM521244", "summary": "cell in solid culture", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "Solid culture ER stress RNA-seq", "Accession": "GSM467150", "summary": "cell under ER stress in solid culture", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "Solid culture control RNA-Seq", "Accession": "GSM467148", "summary": "cell in solid culture", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR avicel[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}]
