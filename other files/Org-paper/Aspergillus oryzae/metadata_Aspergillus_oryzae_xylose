The aim of this work was to understand how metabolism is regulated and to identify common regulatory responses between A. oryzae and A. niger.

The physiology of the recombinant strains and a reference wild type were characterized on glucose, xylose, glycerol and ethanol medium in controlled bioreactors. Glucose was found to be the preferable carbon source for 6-MSA production and 6-MSA titers up to 455 mg/L were achieved. Our findings indicate that overexpression of phk does not directly improve 6-MSA production on glucose but if the lower glycolysis is lowered, it is possible to obtain quite high conversion yields of sugar to 6-MSA. Systems biology tools were employed for in-depth analysis of the metabolic processes. Transcriptome analysis of 6-MSA producing strains on glucose and xylose in the presence and absence of phk overexpression combined with flux and physiology data enabled us to propose a model of phk/6msas interaction describing two different responses influencing 6-MSA production.", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus oryzae\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"xylose\"[MeSH Terms] OR xylose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [19168657]}, {"organism": "Aspergillus oryzae", "source": "Aspergillus oryzae", "title": "A tri-species Aspergillus array (oryzae arrays)", "Accession": "GSE9277", "summary": "The full genome sequencing of the \ufb01lamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae has opened the possibilities for studying the cellular physiology of these fungi on a systemic level.
