Increasing demand for this biofuel has called for investment in new technologies. One example of such technologies is the second-generation (2G) ethanol production. Lignocellulose comprises mainly cellulose and hemicellulose, which consist of high-energy sugars that can be converted into ethanol. Aspergillus sp play an important role in the recycling of lignocellulosic biomass. These species have been investigated as a cell factory to produce industrial enzymes. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms used by Aspergillus sp during degradation of plant biomass and to identify the hydrolytic enzymes secreted by these fungi, we have analyzed the transcriptome and secretome of an Aspergillus species grown on sugarcane bagasse (SEB). A. fumigatus was cultivated in the presence of fructose or SEB. Its cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities depended on time. The maximum activities of endoglucanase and xylanase from the fungus grown on SEB were 0.0029 and 10.82 U mL-1, respectively. Characterization of the transcriptome by RNAseq technology helped to identify genes that participated in the degradation of the biomass demonstrating potential application in the process of enzymatic hydrolysis. The RNAseq data revealed that 2287 genes were differentially expressed in the fungus grown on SEB; 1181 and 1046 of these genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. There were several CAZymes among the up-regulated genes. Most of these enzymes belonged to the GH family, which includes important hydrolytic and accessory enzymes involved in the degradation of lignocellulose. Similarly, proteomic studies showed that a total of 130 proteins existed in the fungus grown on SEB. These proteins were classified into several groups of secreted extracellular enzymes, and their functional classification demonstrated that 59% of the proteins were CAZymes such as GH45-endoglucanases, GH6 and GH7-cellobiohydrolases, GH3-\u03b2-glucosidases, GH10-xylanases, and AA9-LPMO. Data obtained by transcriptome and secretome analyses indicated that A. fumigatus produces a considerable number of CAZymes that participate in the hydrolysis of biomass. These CAZymes are valuable for the lignocellulosic bioenergy industry, provide information for future studies on the degradation of biomass, and improve understanding of the role genes and enzymes play in the degradation process.", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus fumigatus\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus fumigatus\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus fumigatus[All Fields]) AND (\"carbon\"[MeSH Terms] OR carbon[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [29614953]}, {"organism": "Aspergillus fumigatus", "source": "Aspergillus fumigatus", "title": "Gene expression changes in the absence of the carbon catabolite repressor, CreA.", "Accession": "GSE97539", "summary": "This experiment was designed to test the change in gene expression in the absence of the transcription factor, CreA.

Transcriptome sequencing revealed a group of genes underlying a rapid and highly dynamic regulation.

Previous studies have shown that siderophore-mediated uptake and intracellular handling of iron are crucial for virulence of Aspergillus fumigatus. Here we show that the bzip-type transcription factor HapX plays a crucial role in the transcriptional remodeling required for adaption to iron starvation in this opportunistic fungal pathogen. HapX was found to be interconnected in a negative feed-back loop with the previously identified iron regulator SreA: SreA repressed expression of hapX during iron sufficiency and HapX repressed sreA during iron starvation. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling and analysis of selected metabolites (protophorphyrine IX, siderophores and amino acids) indicated extensive metabolic remodeling in response to iron starvation. HapX was found to participate in both, repression and activation of genes during iron starvation. HapX was in particular required for repression of iron-dependent and mitochondrial-localized activities including respiration, TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur-cluster biosynthesis and heme biosynthesis. Pathways positively affected by HapX included production of siderophores and the ribotoxin and major allergen AspF1. Analysis of the free amino acid pool revealed HapX-dependent coordination of the production of siderophores with the supply of its precursor ornithine. Consistent with the hapX expression pattern, HapX-deficiency was deleterious with respect to growth rate and conidiation during iron depleted but not iron-replete conditions. HapX-deficiency caused significant attenuation of virulence in a murine model aspergillosis underlining that A. fumigatus faces iron starvation in the host and that the HapX-dependent metabolic reprogramming is therefore crucial for virulence.", "keywords": "(\"Aspergillus fumigatus\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Aspergillus fumigatus\"[Organism] OR Aspergillus fumigatus[All Fields]) AND (\"carbon\"[MeSH Terms] OR carbon[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [20941352]}, {"organism": "Aspergillus fumigatus", "source": "Aspergillus fumigatus", "title": "[HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array", "Accession": "GPL570", "summary": "Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html June 03, 2009: annotation table updated with netaffx build 28 June 06, 2012: annotation table updated with netaffx build 32 June 23, 2016: annotation table updated with netaffx build 35 Protocol: see manufacturer's web site Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array.
