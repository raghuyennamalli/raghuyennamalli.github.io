Perception and proper interpretation of environmental signals is crucial for survival in any natural habitat. Although the biotechnological workhorse Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) is predominantly known for its capability of efficient plant cell wall degradation, recent studies show that it has not lost its evolutionary heritage. Transmission of nutrient signals via the heterotrimeric G protein pathway has been shown to be influenced by light. We show that this interconnection is mainly established by the light regulatory protein ENV1 and the phosducin-like protein PhLP1 via mutual transcriptional regulation and influence on GNB1 (G protein beta subunit) function. ENV1 thereby exerts a more severe effect on gene transcription than BLR1 or BLR2. Lack of either one of the photoreceptors or PhLP1, GNB1 or GNG1 leads to a partial shutdown of processes upregulated in light, indicating that heterotrimeric G protein signalling exerts its major function in light and is a target of the light response machinery. Consequently, signals transmitted via the G protein pathway are of different relevance in light and darkness. Investigation of regulation of glycoside hydrolases as one of the major output pathways of this mechanism revealed that 79% of all genes belonging to this group, representing all GH-families available in T. reesei, are potentially responsive to light. We conclude that ENV1 is a key factor in connecting nutrient signalling with light response and establishes a signalling output pathway independent of BLR1 and BLR2.", "keywords": "(\"Trichoderma virens\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Trichoderma virens\"[Organism] OR Trichoderma virens[All Fields]) AND (\"carbon\"[MeSH Terms] OR carbon[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [24893562, 31358805, 28809958, 24070552]}, {"organism": "Trichoderma virens", "source": "Trichoderma virens", "title": "The role of photoreceptors in the light modulated cellulase gene expression in Neurospora crassa", "Accession": "GSE32871", "summary": "Light represents an important environmental cue, which exerts considerable influence on the metabolism of fungi. Studies with the biotechnological fungal workhorse Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) have revealed an interconnection between transcriptional regulation of cellulolytic enyzmes and the light response. The filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa, has been used as a model organism to study light and circadian rhythm biology. We therefore investigated whether light also regulates transcriptional regulation of cellulolytic enzymes in N. crassa. We show that the N. crassa photoreceptor genes wc-1, wc-2 and vvd are involved in regulation of cellulase gene expression, indicating that this phenomenon is conserved among filamentous fungi. Genome wide analysis of photoreceptor mutants and evaluation of results by analysis of mutant strains identified several candidate genes likely to play a role in light modulated cellulase gene expression.", "keywords": "(\"Trichoderma virens\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Trichoderma virens\"[Organism] OR Trichoderma virens[All Fields]) AND (\"carbon\"[MeSH Terms] OR carbon[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [22462823, 24070552]}, {"organism": "Trichoderma virens", "source": "Trichoderma virens", "title": "The CRE1 carbon catabolite repressor of the fungus Trichoderma reesei: a master regulator of carbon assimilation", "Accession": "GSE21072", "summary": "The identification and characterization of the transcriptional regulatory networks governing the physiological behaviour and adaptation of microbial cells is a key step in understanding their behaviour. One such wide-domain regulatory circuit, essential to all cells, is carbon catabolite repression (CCR): it allows the cell to prefer some carbon sources, whose assimilation is of high nutritional value, over less profitable ones. This system has been investigated in bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. In the latter, the C2H2 zinc finger protein has been shown to act as the central transcriptional repressor in this process.
