Previously we identified the Zn2Cys6 transcription factor (TF) AraR that has this role in the Trichocomaceae family (Eurotiales), but is absent in other fungi. Candidate Zn2Cys6 TF genes were selected according to their transcript profiles on L-arabinose. Deletion mutants of these genes were screened for their growth phenotype on L-arabinose. One mutant, named \u0394ara1, was further analyzed. Our analysis demonstrated that Ara1 from P. oryzae is the functional homolog of AraR from A. niger, while sequence analysis did not reveal significant homology between them.", "keywords": "(\"Pyricularia oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Pyricularia oryzae\"[Organism] OR Pyricularia oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"glucose\"[MeSH Terms] OR glucose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [26790567]}, {"organism": "Pyricularia oryzae", "source": "Pyricularia oryzae", "title": "DNA methylation dynamics during development in the rice blast fungus", "Accession": "GSE43845", "summary": "This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.", "keywords": "(\"Pyricularia oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Pyricularia oryzae\"[Organism] OR Pyricularia oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"glucose\"[MeSH Terms] OR glucose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Pyricularia oryzae", "source": "Pyricularia oryzae", "title": "DNA methylation dynamics during development in the rice blast fungus [Bisulfite-Seq]", "Accession": "GSE43844", "summary": "Cytosine methylation is an important epigenetic modification of DNA that is involved in genome defense and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes.

Magnaporthe oryzae, its causal agent is likely to encounter environmental challenges during invasive growth in the host plants that require shifts in gene expression to establish a compatible interaction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that M. oryzae have similar gene expression patterns in planta, versus during in vitro stresses. Gene expression data was collected from in vitro experiments of heat shock, oxidative burst, and three different types of nutrient starvation. These data were compared to fungal gene expression during the invasive growth phase in compatible interactions on two grass hosts, rice and barley. We have identified 4,973 differentially expressed genes, from which 1,909 genes showed similar regulation patterns between at least one of the in vitro stresses and rice and/or barley. Hierarchical clustering of these 1,909 genes showed three major clusters in which growth in planta conditions closely grouped with the starving nutrient conditions. Out of these 1,909 genes, 55 and 129 genes were induced and repressed in all seven treatments, respectively. The functional categorization of those 55 induced genes revealed that most of them are either related to carbon metabolism, membrane proteins, or are involved in oxidoreduction reactions. The 129 repressed genes are putatively involved in vesicle trafficking, signal transduction, nitrogen metabolism, or molecular transport. These findings indicated that M. oryzae is likely coping with nutrient deprived environments in its hosts during the invasive growth stage about 72 hours post-inoculation, and not as much with host defense responses, or a temperature stress.", "keywords": "(\"Pyricularia oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Pyricularia oryzae\"[Organism] OR Pyricularia oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"glucose\"[MeSH Terms] OR glucose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [21247492]}, {"organism": "Pyricularia oryzae", "source": "Pyricularia oryzae", "title": "Analysis of the Interaction Transcriptome During Biotrophic Invasion of Rice by the Blast Fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae", "Accession": "GSE8670", "summary": "This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.", "keywords": "(\"Pyricularia oryzae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Pyricularia oryzae\"[Organism] OR Pyricularia oryzae[All Fields]) AND (\"glucose\"[MeSH Terms] OR glucose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [19357089]}, {"organism": "Pyricularia oryzae", "source": "Pyricularia oryzae", "title": "Rice Gene Expression During Biotrophic Invasion by Magnaporthe oryzae (Agilent Array G4138A)", "Accession": "GSE8518", "summary": "The hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae produces specialized biotrophic invasive hyphae (IH) that alter membrane structure and defense responses in invaded rice cells.
