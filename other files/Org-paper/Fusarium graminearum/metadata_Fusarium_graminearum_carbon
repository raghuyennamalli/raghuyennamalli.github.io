As a global transcriptional regulator, TRI6 expression is modulated by nitrogen-limiting conditions, sources of nitrogen and carbon, pH, and light. However, the mechanism by which these diverse environmental factors affect TRI6 expression remains under-explored. In our effort to understand how nutrients affect TRI6 regulation, comparative digital expression profiling was performed with a wildtype F. graminearum and a \u0394tri6 mutant strain, grown in nutrient-rich conditions. Analysis showed that TRI6 negatively regulates genes of the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolic pathway. Feeding studies with deletion mutants of MCC, encoding methylcrotonyl-CoA-carboxylase, one of the key enzymes of leucine metabolism, showed that addition of leucine specifically down regulated TRI6 expression and reduced 15-ADON accumulation. Constitutive expression of TRI6 in the \u0394mcc mutant strain restored 15-ADON production. A combination of cellophane breach assays and pathogenicity experiments on wheat demonstrated that disrupting the leucine metabolic pathway significantly reduced disease. These findings suggest a complex interaction between one of the primary metabolic pathways with a global regulator of mycotoxin biosynthesis and virulence in F. graminearum.", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"carbon\"[MeSH Terms] OR carbon[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [26248604]}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Transcriptional responses of Fusarium graminearum to plant cell wall substrates", "Accession": "GSE29973", "summary": "We report a complete transcriptomic study of Fusarium graminearum in response to glucose, cellulose, xylan and cell wall fragments with a whole genome microarray from febit.", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"carbon\"[MeSH Terms] OR carbon[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}]
