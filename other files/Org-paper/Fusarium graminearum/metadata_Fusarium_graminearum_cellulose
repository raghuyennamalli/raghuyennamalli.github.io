Homothallic C. globosum produces hairy perithecia bearing meiotic ascospores that are resistant to harsh conditions for dispersal, and asexual reproduction of conidia has never been observed. RNAs were samples from nine distinct morphological stages during the nearly synchronic perithecial development for C. globosum. Unlike the heterothallic Neurospora crassa, the mating type gene mat a-1 showed comparatively lower expression changes but highly coordinate with expression regulation of mat A-1 in C. globosum. Key regulators, including orthologs of N. crassa sub-1, \u00a0sub-1 dependent gene NCU00309, and asl-1, in the initiation of sexual development in response to light stimuli, showed similar regulation dynamics between C. globosum and N. crassa. Knockout phenotyping directed by the comparative analysis of transcriptomics between C. globosum and its\u2019 closely related Neurospora crassa also suggested some genes that are critical for perithecial development. Among 24 secondary metabolism clusters composed more than 3 genes in C. globosum, 11 showed highly coordinated expression across the perithecial development, and dramatically up-regulation was recorded for all 12 genes in the cochliodones biosynthesis cluster. Up-regulation of chaetoglocin and aureonitol biosynthesis clusters was found to be associated with disturbance in early sexual development and with ascospore maturation. Similar to pathogenic Fusarium graminearum, C. globosum showed coordinately up-regulated expression of homologs of histidine kinases in hyperosmotic response pathways, consist with their ecology adapting to high humidity.", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [31822585]}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Leucine metabolism regulates TRI6 expression and affects deoxynivalenol production and virulence in Fusarium graminearum", "Accession": "GSE71604", "summary": "TRI6 is a positive regulator of the trichothecene gene cluster and the production of trichothecene mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol [DON] and acetylated forms such as 15-ADON) in the cereal pathogen F. graminearum. As a global transcriptional regulator, TRI6 expression is modulated by nitrogen-limiting conditions, sources of nitrogen and carbon, pH, and light. However, the mechanism by which these diverse environmental factors affect TRI6 expression remains under-explored. In our effort to understand how nutrients affect TRI6 regulation, comparative digital expression profiling was performed with a wildtype F. graminearum and a \u0394tri6 mutant strain, grown in nutrient-rich conditions. Analysis showed that TRI6 negatively regulates genes of the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolic pathway. Feeding studies with deletion mutants of MCC, encoding methylcrotonyl-CoA-carboxylase, one of the key enzymes of leucine metabolism, showed that addition of leucine specifically down regulated TRI6 expression and reduced 15-ADON accumulation. Constitutive expression of TRI6 in the \u0394mcc mutant strain restored 15-ADON production. A combination of cellophane breach assays and pathogenicity experiments on wheat demonstrated that disrupting the leucine metabolic pathway significantly reduced disease. These findings suggest a complex interaction between one of the primary metabolic pathways with a global regulator of mycotoxin biosynthesis and virulence in F. graminearum.", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": [26248604]}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Gene expression in wheat heads treated with the mutant noxAB\u0394 of Fusarium graminearum, which produces a priming-induced resistance to fusarium head blight", "Accession": "GSE69490", "summary": "Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major disease of cereal crops caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg). FHB affects the flowering heads (or spikes) and developing seeds. This study compares the gene expression profile of heads from the susceptible cultivar Roblin after inoculation with either water (dH2O) or the disarmed Fg strain noxAB\u0394 (NoxAB). noxAB\u0394 is a double deletion mutant of NoxA and NoxB, which function are component of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex converting molecular oxygen in a stepwise reduction to superoxides leading to the production of H2O2. Deletion mutants of Nos A and B have been described in more details in Li Wang, Christopher Mogg, Sean Walkowiak, Manisha Joshi & Rajagopal Subramaniam (2014).

This manuscript characterizes the role of the catalytic subunit (gp91phox) of Nox, NoxA and NoxB in F. graminearum. Targeted deletion of NoxA and NoxB show that these genes differentially regulate the production of superoxides during mycelia development. The nitro blue tetrazolium staining revealed that both the single noxA mutant and the double noxA/B mutant strains are restricted in the production of superoxides. This limitation, however, did not affect their ability to synthesize 15-ADON in culture. Deletion analyses also revealed that NoxA, but not NoxB is involved in perithecia development and ascospore production. An in-vitro based cellophane breach assay indicated that both NoxA and NoxB contribute to virulence. The pathogenicity tests performed on a susceptible variety of wheat, \u2018Roblin\u2019 confirmed that these two genes act synergistically to promote virulence. Cumulatively, we provide evidence that the Nox homologues have non-redundant functions in F. graminearum.", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Transcriptional responses of Fusarium graminearum to plant cell wall substrates", "Accession": "GSE29973", "summary": "We report a complete transcriptomic study of Fusarium graminearum in response to glucose, cellulose, xylan and cell wall fragments with a whole genome microarray from febit.", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose 4", "Accession": "GSM741922", "summary": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose 4", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose 3", "Accession": "GSM741921", "summary": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose 3", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose 2", "Accession": "GSM741920", "summary": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose 2", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}, {"organism": "Fusarium graminearum", "source": "Fusarium graminearum", "title": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose", "Accession": "GSM741353", "summary": "Fusarium graminearum grown on cellulose", "keywords": "(\"Fusarium graminearum\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"Fusarium graminearum\"[Organism] OR Fusarium graminearum[All Fields]) AND (\"cellulose\"[MeSH Terms] OR cellulose[All Fields]) ", "pubmed": []}]
